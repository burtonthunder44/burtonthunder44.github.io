            <p>He a dog breed who’s got it all in one small package: intelligence, affection, an extroverted temperament, humor, and a personality that’s twice as big as he is. Throw in that walrus moustache and quivering enthusiasm, and he’ll make you laugh every day. With a Miniature Schnauzer in the house, you’ll never be alone, not even when you go to the bathroom. He’s got personality-plus, and whether he’s bounding around ahead of you or curled up snoozing on your lap, you’ll never be bored with him around.</p>

            <h2>Golden Labador</h2>
            <img src href="golden-lab.jpg" class="bgpic">
            <p>Loving, devoted, and energetic, Goldador mixed-breed dogs are prized for their good-natured trainability. They make great family members — a natural with kids and social with other pets — as well as valuable guide, service, and bomb detection dogs. A dog is a big commitment, so before you take the plunge, make sure you’re all together on wanting this newest member of the family. Then decide who’s going to be the primary caretaker–otherwise you’ll spend lots of time arguing while your new dog stares at his empty food bowl. To avoid confusing the pup, hammer out the house rules ahead of time (will the dog be allowed on the bed? On the couch? Where will the dog sleep? Are any rooms of the house permanently off-limits?).</p>
