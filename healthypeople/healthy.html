<p>We are an organization called Healthy People that reaches out to high school and college students who have mental health illness. The age ranges between 14 to 23.</p> 

<p>We will have weekly events of mental health talks, small groups and a research center for learning more about mental health with possible internships. We encourage high school and college students to come.</p>

<p>Small groups are for the students aged 14 to 23 to learn more about mental health and the awareness of it, learning to read their bodies when knowing what to do if they have a panic attack and healthy coping mechanisms.</p>

<p>Talk Events are for learning more about mental health illness from the guest speakers where you learn about healthy coping mechanisms, and what the mental health illness is.</p>
            
<p><i>Be on the lookout for the postcards weekly in the mail with details about the program sessions!</i></p>
