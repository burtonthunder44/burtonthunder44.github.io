<h1>My Three Website Opinions</h1>

<h2><a href="https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/">Bed Bath and Beyond</a></h2>
<p>The colors are simple where they have white, blue and black. It has too much display of pictures and feels too crowded. I like how their navigation bar is simple where they all keep it in the menu bar which is nice. It helps the display of the home page look neat. I dislike how they overused images on their home page because if you click on their menu button and click on a tab you want to try out such as bedding. the display is much cleaner, have a neat scrolling effect that is not distracting because the page is connected with the scrolling effect. The code seems messy where most of the coding elements that I saw repeat several times was div, li, and script. They didn't use any table elements and used many links to connect all the parts of the home page together. The coding they used validates because they used some elements that we use in class and for assignments too. They had ul class and h3 class elements they used for linking their images and text together. The navigation is well done but with too much images and information is distracting. I displayed it as a mobile screen you would see on a phone. It needs some work because at the top where one of their photos is cut off. The colors are simple which match the audience and products. Their audience would be young teenagers up to adults because we like having a clean and simple house to decorate. Their products are lively and bright colors which matches well with the black, white and blue colors. The font they used looks clean and professional on all their pages. I didn't much HTML 5 elements used. They had bunch of links for images, tabs in their navigation bar and information tabs you can click on to find more about what you are looking. They had a search bar where you type in what you are looking for which was useful. Their shopping area where I clicked on bedding showed a nice display that was less crazy than the home page and less distracting. </p>

<p>The display of the home page is clean, neat, and easy to navigate around. Also, they have a few clothing tips you can look which I find helpful for any audience that may be interested in learning more about it. When I do half a screen like a mobile screen size, some of their information, images, navigation bar which are squished together and unable to see the navigation bar. I like how they set it up but don't like how it is squished up with some of the tabs they have on their images and their social media handlers as well. In some areas their images and text align well. The scroll effect runs smoothly and the page rolls well with the scrolling function as well. The colors they used were the same as what Bed Bath and Beyond used. The colors black and white are simple which match well with the colors of the images they used on their home page and other pages as well. The colors match well with the audience because we enjoy simple colors with nice images that don't have much noise or distraction in them. Both Nordstrom and Bed Bath and Beyond use strong images that capture your attention where you get to see people trying on the clothes and modeling them. I like seeing those kind of images helps me visualize what they look and what kind of other fashion goes well with them. The font they used were arial, helvetica and sans serif which were different from the other websites. It looks neat with the images. The design is unique that fits with the theme and the format of their pages for Nordstrom's image. The layout they have makes sense to me where they start out with exploring section, buying, simple tips to latest fashion and trends going on all the way to fashion tips and fashion updates. I find their layout useful where I can find what outfits are good for different seasons, simple fashion tips, latest updates on fashion styles and recent trends. It was designed well where they have some information with a gray box for background which makes it pop. I love how each website has their own signature style for each of their websites. All the coding that I saw were div, script and many links to images, navigation bar and all the lists of clothing from their navigation bar they have at the top of the home page. I didn't see much HTML 5 elements in the coding when I was inspecting each part they have on their website. </p>

<p>There is too much white space and when I shrink the screen to mobile size the display isn't good. It needs work and better display for the links because I was clicking around but confused on where to navigate to. I like nothing about it because it only shows some information. The colors of blue and gray don't match well. It seemes like someone was in a hurry to make it. I don't think they took their time to think about how well they wanted their website to display. When I displayed it full screen, I could see more on it and the images showed along with navigation bar. The full screen looks way better than a half split screen. The other websites that were split screens they showed everything that you would see when it is fully displayed as well. The scrolling effect is short with not much information on there. The colors don't match well with the products or advertisements they have. Some images work well with the colors and some don't. The white space seems like 25-30% of space but it would look better with the whole space used in a unique way that stands out from other websites. I can't tell what makes them stand out differently except for providing information to the county of health and other resources to keep the city a better place for people to live. </p>
