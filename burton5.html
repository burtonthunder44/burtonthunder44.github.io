<p>If we were to have a contest of who has traveled the most that would be my dad for the win. He has traveled more than any of us since its for work. You can't beat him in that category. My brother would come in second place where as my mom and I are tied for third place. Paul, my brother has been to countries in Europe, Asia, and Canada. Gina and I have been to Canada, Montana and Taiwan. As a family, we spend a few days there, eat delicious food that we try out, check out shops, ski if there is a mountain there, and enjoy family time together. We want to show our photos of places that we have been to and hope to share some information about the places we have been to and what we did there. Our next destination is Leavenworth, Washington for skiing and eating authentic dishes. </p>
